## Python 100 Days Challenge

### Description :

In this 100 days of coding challenge, Iâ€™ve put together a collection of basic Python tasks that I completed while learning from W3Schools. These tasks help me practice important programming concepts like data types, control structures, functions, and file handling.

By working on these tasks, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of Python and apply what I learned. Each task shows my progress and serves as a helpful reminder of the basics as I continue to improve my programming skills.
