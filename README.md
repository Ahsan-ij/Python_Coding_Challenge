## Python 100 Days Challenge

### Description :

In this 100 days of coding challenge, Iâ€™ve put together a collection of basic Python tasks that I completed while learning from W3Schools. These tasks help me practice important programming concepts like data types, control structures, functions, and file handling.

By working on these tasks, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of Python and apply what I learned. Each task shows my progress and serves as a helpful reminder of the basics as I continue to improve my programming skills.

## Key Features:
1) **Comprehensive Collection**: A variety of basic Python tasks that cover essential programming concepts.
2) **Fundamental Concepts**: Includes examples of data types, control structures, and functions to reinforce foundational knowledge.
3) **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on tasks that encourage practical application of learned concepts.
4) **Clear Documentation**: Each task is documented to explain its purpose and functionality, making it easier to understand.
5) **Learning Progress**: Reflects my journey of learning Python, showcasing growth and improvement over time.
 
## How to run this Project:
